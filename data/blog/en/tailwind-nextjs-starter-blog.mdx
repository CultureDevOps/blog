## Docker: Deploy the Blog Easily

For those who want to use Docker, here is a sample configuration. Full files can be found in [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/CultureDevOps/blog).

### Sample Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM jitesoft/node-yarn:19

ADD package.json /package.json

ENV NODE_PATH=/node_modules
ENV PATH=$PATH:/node_modules/.bin
ENV YARN_VERSION 3.6.1

RUN yarn policies set-version $YARN_VERSION

WORKDIR /app
ADD . /app

RUN yarn

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["yarn","dev"]
```

We use a specialized **yarn** image, which offers better performance compared to a standard Node image.

### Sample docker-compose.yml

```yml
version: '3.8'
services:

  blog:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    stdin_open: true
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - '.:/app'
      - './node_modules:/app/node_modules:cached'
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

### Installation Instructions

1. **Initialize Yarn Dependencies**:
   
Create a temporary container to access its console:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm blog sh
```
Once inside the container, run:
```bash
yarn install
```

2. **Start the Stack**:
   
After installing the dependencies, exit the container and run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
