When building Docker images in a CI/CD pipeline, it's often necessary to use Docker images that can run Docker commands themselves.  
In some cases, such as for personal use, it’s often more advantageous to use a self-hosted agent, whether on a third-party server or on your own machine, rather than relying on the agents provided by Azure.

To make it easier for you, I’ve prepared a ready-to-use Docker image: [https://github.com/CultureDevOps/simple-azp-agent-docker-dind](https://github.com/CultureDevOps/simple-azp-agent-docker-dind).

### How an Azure Pipeline Works with a Self-Hosted Agent

![Azure Pipeline](https://d2mezi5ylxaxvl.cloudfront.net/blog/simple-azp-agent-dind/AZP+Agent.drawio.png?format=auto)

The developer commits their code with a `Dockerfile` in the Azure repository. This commit then triggers the pipeline execution.  
Meanwhile, the self-hosted agent runs in the background on a machine, regularly polling the Azure pipeline to check if it should start working.  
Once the pipeline is triggered, the agent builds the Docker image and pushes it to Azure Container Registry.

### Using the Agent on a Linux Machine

In the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CultureDevOps/simple-azp-agent-docker-dind), you’ll find the `docker-compose-linux.yml` file.  

Start by adjusting the environment variables to match your Azure DevOps account:

```yml:docker-compose-linux.yml
version: "3.8"

services:  
  dind:  
    image: culturedevops/simple-azp-agent-docker-dind:latest  
    tty: true  
    restart: unless-stopped  
    volumes:  
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"  
    environment:  
      AZP_URL: "https://dev.azure.com/youraccount"  
      AZP_AGENT_NAME: "azure-agent-desktop"  
      AZP_POOL: "azure-agent"  
      AZP_TOKEN: "Your Token Here"  
```

To start the agent, navigate to the directory and run the following command:  
```sh
docker-compose -f "docker-compose-linux.yml" up -d
```

### Using the Agent on a Windows Machine

Similarly, in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CultureDevOps/simple-azp-agent-docker-dind), you’ll find the `docker-compose-windows.yml` file. Modify the environment variables as indicated.

```yml:docker-compose-windows.yml 
version: "3.8"

services:  
  dind:  
    image: culturedevops/simple-azp-agent-docker-dind:latest  
    tty: true  
    restart: unless-stopped  
    volumes:  
      - "//var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"  
    group_add:  
      - "0"  
    environment:  
      AZP_URL: "https://dev.azure.com/youraccount"  
      AZP_AGENT_NAME: "azure-agent-desktop"  
      AZP_POOL: "azure-agent"  
      AZP_TOKEN: "Your Token Here"  
```

To start the agent, navigate to the directory and run the following command:  
```sh
docker-compose -f "docker-compose-windows.yml" up -d
```

### Verifying the Agent in Azure

Once the agent is running, you can verify that it’s working correctly by going to **Organisation Settings > Agent Pools > Your Pool > Agents**.

### Example of an Azure Pipeline to Build a Docker Image

Create an `azure-pipelines.yml` file at the root of your project and configure the variables as follows:  

```yml:azure-pipelines.yml 
# Docker  
# Build and push an image to Azure Container Registry  
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/docker

trigger:  
- main

resources:  
- repo: self

variables:  
  dockerRegistryServiceConnection: '<SERVICE_CONNECTION_NAME>'  
  imageRepository: '<IMAGE_NAME>'  
  containerRegistry: 'yourregistry.azurecr.io'  
  tag: '$(Build.BuildId)'
  dockerfile: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/Dockerfile'
  dockerimage: '$(imageRepository)/docker_image'
  agentName: 'azure-agent'
  vmImageName: 'alpine'

stages:  
- stage: Build  
  displayName: Build and push stage  
  pool:  
    name: $(agentName)
    vmImage: $(vmImageName)    
  jobs:  
  - job: Build_docker_image  
    displayName: Build Docker Image  
    steps:  
    - task: Docker@2  
      displayName: Build and push an image to container registry  
      inputs:  
        command: buildAndPush  
        repository: $(dockerimage)
        dockerfile: $(dockerfile)
        containerRegistry: $(dockerRegistryServiceConnection)  
        tags: |  
          latest
```

After making these configurations, push your `Dockerfile` to Azure Repos. After a few seconds, the pipeline will be triggered automatically, and your Docker image will be built. You can monitor the execution of the pipeline in the **Pipelines** tab of your project.

### Conclusion

You now have a simple and efficient method for building Docker images in Azure Pipelines. By using a self-hosted agent, you can easily integrate Docker into your CI/CD pipeline on Azure.
