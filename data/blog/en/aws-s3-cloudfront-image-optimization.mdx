In today's web world, site speed and efficiency are essential factors for:  
- providing an optimal user experience,  
- and improving SEO.  

Images, while indispensable for enriching visual content, often make up a significant portion of the data to be loaded, which directly impacts performance.  

This is where **Content Delivery Networks (CDN)** and image optimization solutions come into play.  

With **AWS S3** and **CloudFront**, you can:  
- store your files reliably,  
- deliver your content quickly,  
- and optimize your images to reduce loading times, while preserving their quality.  

In this article, we will explore how to configure and use these tools to transform your site into a fast and efficient platform.

## Architecture

Amazon offers an out-of-the-box solution for distributing and optimizing your images. You can learn more about their approach here: [Image Optimization Using Amazon CloudFront and AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/image-optimization-using-amazon-cloudfront-and-aws-lambda/).

This solution relies on **AWS Lambda**, which allows you to transform your images into optimized formats such as **WebP**, **AVIF**, or **JPEG**.

To better understand how the architecture works, here is a diagram illustrating the exchange between CloudFront, Lambda, and S3:

### Concept

- Images are stored in an **Amazon S3 bucket**.  
- Instead of making this bucket publicly accessible, they are distributed via **CloudFront**, with a specific access policy (OAC) that prevents direct requests to the S3 bucket.  
- When a visitor accesses an image on your site, **CloudFront** invokes a **Lambda** function to generate an optimized version of the image, suitable for the format supported by the browser. This image is then cached for future visitors.  
- If the optimized image is already in the CloudFront cache, it is served directly, avoiding any calls to Lambda or S3.  

The URL of an optimized image looks like this:  
```bash
https://example.cloudfront.net/images/cats/mycat.jpg?format=webp&width=200
```

You can also let **CloudFront** automatically choose the best format (JPEG, WebP, or AVIF) by using the `format=auto` directive. This choice is based on the `Accept` header of the request sent by the browser.  

In the example above, the `/images/cats/mycat.jpg` part corresponds to the image path in your S3 bucket.

## The Amazon Solution

To simplify the deployment and use of this architecture, I have prepared a fork of the original GitHub repository provided by Amazon:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CultureDevOps/docker-aws-image-optimization.git
```

This fork contains an optimized configuration, making it easier to deploy Amazon's solution in a Docker environment with minimal effort.

---

## Initial Setup

In the `aws` directory, configure the `credentials` and `config` files to connect the application to your AWS account.  

**`config`**  
```ini
[default]
# Specify your preferred AWS region
region = eu-west-3
output = json
```

**`credentials`**  
```ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <ACCESS_KEY>
aws_secret_access_key = <SECRET_KEY>
```

Make sure to replace `<ACCESS_KEY>` and `<SECRET_KEY>` with your AWS credentials.

### Installing Node.js Dependencies

To initialize the necessary dependencies, run the following command:  
```bash
docker-compose run --rm image-optimizer npm install
```  

---

## Deploying the Solution

Once your configuration is ready, you can use Docker to provision and deploy the necessary infrastructure.

### Accessing the Docker Environment  
Launch the Docker environment and access the console:  
```bash
docker-compose run --rm image-optimizer bash
```  

### Deployment Commands  
From the Docker console, run the following commands:  
```bash
cdk bootstrap
npm run build
cdk deploy -c S3_IMAGE_BUCKET_NAME=<S3_BUCKET_NAME>
```  

**Notes:**  
- Replace `<S3_BUCKET_NAME>` with the name of your S3 bucket.  
- If no bucket is specified, the process will automatically create an S3 bucket with an example file: `/images/rio/1.jpeg`.  

### Removing Resources  
If you want to remove the resources created in your AWS account at the end of the test, use the following command:  
```bash
cdk destroy
```  
---

## Verification

You can test the solution by accessing the following URL:  
```bash
https://<DISTRIBUTION>.cloudfront.net/images/rio/1.jpeg?format=auto&width=300
```

Replace `<DISTRIBUTION>` with the name of your CloudFront distribution (available in the AWS console).  

> **Tip**: The URL of an optimized image corresponds to the image path in the S3 bucket, preceded by the CloudFront distribution domain.

## Conclusion

By combining **AWS S3**, **CloudFront**, and **Lambda**, you can efficiently optimize your images, reduce loading times, and improve the user experience. With this architecture, your images are served in modern formats like **WebP**, **JPEG**, or **AVIF**, perfectly suited to different browsers.

Take the example of the image below: it weighs 6.2 MB when stored in my **S3** bucket, but once optimized and served via **CloudFront** in the **WebP** format, itâ€™s only 48 KB. This significant reduction in size, with no noticeable loss of quality, clearly shows the benefits of image optimization in a CDN environment.

By adopting this solution, you ensure fast and performant delivery of your images, while reducing bandwidth usage and providing a better experience for users.
