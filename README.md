# Welcome to my blog dedicated to IT technologies and the DevOps culture!

Passionate about IT since I began my career in 2007 as a Cobol developer, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects, exploring technologies such as Java, Oracle, Python, JavaScript, PHP, Docker, and many more. My journey as a self-taught professional has allowed me to develop a diverse expertise, ranging from full-stack development to system maintenance, including monitoring and performance optimization.

Since 2018, I have been particularly focused on the DevOps culture, an approach that aims to unify software development, deployment, and system monitoring. This blog is the result of my curiosity and passion for IT technologies.

My goal is to share with you practical tips, insights into best practices, and technical discoveries that I hope will enrich your own journey in this exciting field. Whether you are a developer, a systems engineer, or simply a curious mind, you will find resources and ideas here to fuel your thirst for knowledge.

Feel free to explore, comment, and contribute to this dialogue around IT technologies and DevOps culture!
